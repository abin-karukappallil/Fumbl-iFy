# Fumbl-iFy: Turning Seriousness into Silliness!

Fumbl-iFy is a Chrome extension designed to inject a playful twist into any topic by generating absurd or nonsensical responses. This extension is usable on any website with text input fields and allows users to activate the feature with a simple command: `ify("your text")`. The input text is then sent to an AI model hosted on Hugging Face, which generates a useless response that appears in the input field where the command was invoked.

## Project Description
Fumbl-ify is a Chrome extension that takes any topic and humorously rephrases it into an exaggerated, silly version. Itâ€™s designed to bring a bit of levity and laughter to otherwise mundane or serious topics.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People often take things way too seriously. Important or formal topics can be, letâ€™s face it, a bit dry. We thoughtâ€”what if there were a way to add a splash of humor to any topic?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our extension, Fumbl-ify, injects ridiculous, humorous spins on user-provided topics. Itâ€™s like having your own personal jester who turns mundane topics into quirky, amusing ones at the click of a button!

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

#### For Software:
- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python
- **Frameworks**: React, NextJs, Tailwind CSS 
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Hugging Face API
- **AI Model**: HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta
- **Libraries**: `webextension-polyfill` for chrome extension
- **Tools**: Chrome Developer Tools, VS Code, Git

#### For Hardware:
No hardware components are required as this is a purely software-based project.

### Implementation

1. User Interaction: The user types ify("some text") into any input field or textarea on a website.
2. Capturing Input: The extension utilizes the `webextension-polyfill` library to interact with the DOM, capturing the userâ€™s input when the command is detected.
3. Processing Input: The captured text is sent to the AI model `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta` hosted on Hugging Face, which generate a humorously exaggerated or absurd response.
4. Displaying Output: The generated response is displayed back in the input field and consists of useless or nonsensical content, providing a humorous twist to the original topic.
