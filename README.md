## Project Description
Fumbl-ify is a Chrome extension that takes any topic and humorously rephrases it into an exaggerated, silly version. Itâ€™s designed to bring a bit of levity and laughter to otherwise mundane or serious topics.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People often take things way too seriously. Important or formal topics can be, letâ€™s face it, a bit dry. We thoughtâ€”what if there were a way to add a splash of humor to any topic?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our extension, Fumbl-ify, injects ridiculous, humorous spins on user-provided topics. Itâ€™s like having your own personal jester who turns mundane topics into quirky, amusing ones at the click of a button!
